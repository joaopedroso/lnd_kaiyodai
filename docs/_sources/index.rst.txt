solve_lnd: Main example for testing logistics network design optimizer

This program illustrates how to use the optimization model implemented
in module `lnd.py`, with potential places for distribution centers
being pre-clustered by the method implemented in `clustering.py`.

The source code is available `here <https://github.com/joaopedroso/lnd_kaiyodai>`_.
