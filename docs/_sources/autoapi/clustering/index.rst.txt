.. py:module:: clustering

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   clustering: Use scikit-learn models for clustering a set of distribution centers.

   The aim is to select a predefined number of *candidates* for implementing
   a distribution center.  Data are: 

     - number of candidates to select
     - customer locations
     - potential distribution center locations
     - plant locations

   See `TestSolving` below for examples of usage.



Module Contents
---------------

.. function:: preclustering(cust, dc, prods, demand, n_clusters)

   Clustering as a predecessor for optimization, to be used in logistics network design

   :rtype: list of selected dc's (a subset of `dc`)
   :cust: dict associating a customer id to its location as (latitute, longitude)
   :dc: dict associating a distribution center id to its (latitute, longitude)
   :prods: list (set) of products 
   :demand: demand[k,p] -> units of `p` demanded by customer `k`
   :n_clusters: number of clusters to use


.. py:class:: TestClustering

   Bases: :class:`unittest.TestCase`

   
   .. method:: test_one(self)

      Test optimizing the location of a small number of dc's from set of candidates
