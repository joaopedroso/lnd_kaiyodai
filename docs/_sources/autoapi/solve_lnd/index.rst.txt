   solve_lnd: Main example for testing logistics network design optimizer

   This program illustrates how to use the optimization model implemented
   in module `lnd.py`, with potential places for distribution centers
   being pre-clustered by the method implemented in `clustering.py`.

   Notice that for large instances, completing the tests may still take
   a considerable time.
